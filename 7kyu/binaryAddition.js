Binary Addition

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)

//input / params are going to be 2 nums 2 inputs
// always whole positive nums
//return the 2 params added together which is their sum, the sum is converted into binary needs to be returned as a string 
//start out by adding the inputs togther to get the sum, 
//take the sum convert it to binary 
//convert the binary sum to a string
//return the string





*/

function addBinary(n1, n2){
 let sum= n1 + n2 
 //convert the sum to binary

 //return this as a string
 return 
}


console.log(addBinary(1, 1)) //2 => 10
console.log(addBinary(5, 9 )) //14 => 1110
