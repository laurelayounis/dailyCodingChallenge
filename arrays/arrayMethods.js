/* SEARCHING IN AN ARRAY

.indexOf() & .includes have similar syntax & do essentialy the same at their string counterparts but
operate on items instead of characters:

indexOf()
the methods indexOf(item, from)
 - looks for item starting from index from, and returns the index where it was found 
otherwise if not found returns -1

.includes(item, from) l
-ooks for item starting from index from, returns true if found

usually these methods are used with only one argument: the item to search
By default the search is from the beginning

indexOf() uses strict equality === for comparison, so if we look for false it finds exactly false and not the zero

*if we want to check if item exists in the array & dont need the exact index then arr.includes() is preferred

.lastIndexOf() is the same as indexOf() but looks from left to right
*/

let arr= [1, 0, false]

alert( arr.indexOf(0) )// 1
alert( arr.indexOf(false) )//2
alert( arr.indexOf(null) )// -1   (returns -1 because null isnt in the arr)

arr.includes(1) //true
arr.includes(null)  //false

let fruits= ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Apple']

alert( fruits.indexOf('Apple') )// 0 (alerts the first instance of apple is index 0)
alert( fruits.lastIndexOf('Apple') ) // 2 (alerts the last instance of apple since it starts from left to right)

//includes() handles NaN correctly unlike indexOf() because includes() was added to JS later & uses comparison more correctly




/* How to find an object with a specific condition in an array

.find()
let result= arr.find(function(item, index, array)){

}

the function is called for elements of the array one after the other
-item: is the element
-index: is its index
-array: is the array itself

if it reutrns true the search is stopped, the item is returned, if nothing found undefined is returned


.findIndex() //similar syntax to .find() but returns the index where the element was found instead 
of the element itself
-1 is returned if nothing is found
